<h3>This is a current work in progress project.</h3>
<p>      
    <h4>How was it developed...?</h4>
        The idea behind this project is to create a self substainable farm, with the parameters of reducing the
        large scale footprint of farming.
    <h4>What inspired this project...?</h4>
        The inspriration of this project came to me while going into my local grocery stores and seeing the label of
        "Organic" on the wrapping of fruits and veggies. The uncertainty of that is what sparked the inspiration
        towards this project.
    <h4>How does the project look like now...?</h4>
